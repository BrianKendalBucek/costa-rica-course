      <p>
        This course was born out of the personal journey of its creator, a
        Canadian expat who made the life-changing decision to move to Costa Rica
        several years ago. Faced with the challenges and adventures of adapting
        to a new culture, navigating the legal intricacies of residency, and
        learning the ropes of living in a foreign land, they recognized a gap in
        available resources for those looking to make a similar move. Leveraged
        by their firsthand experiences, trials, and successes, the course is
        designed to offer a roadmap to prospective expats. <br />
        <br />
        It encapsulates years of accumulated knowledge, insights, and practical
        advice, aiming to smooth the path for others by providing a
        comprehensive guide to relocating, settling, and thriving in the
        beautiful and diverse country of Costa Rica. The creator&apos;s passion
        for their adopted home and desire to share the beauty of expat life with
        others is the driving force behind this course, making it not just a set
        of instructions but a personal guide infused with love and enthusiasm
        for Costa Rican life.
